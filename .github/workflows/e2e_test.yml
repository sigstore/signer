    # panic: [launcher] Failed to get the debug url: [9175:9175:0114/132426.963765:FATAL:zygote_host_impl_linux.cc(126)] No usable sandbox! Update your kernel or see https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/linux/suid_sandbox_development.md for more information on developing with the SUID sandbox. If you want to live dangerously and need an immediate workaround, you can try using --no-sandbox.
